A GitHub action to create a pull request for changes to your repository in the actions workspace.

Changes to a repository in the Actions workspace persist between steps in a workflow.
This action is designed to be used in conjunction with other steps that modify or add files to your repository.
The changes will be automatically committed to a new branch and a pull request created.

Create Pull Request action will:

1. Check for repository changes in the Actions workspace. This includes untracked (new) files as well as modified files.
2. Commit all changes to a new branch, or update an existing pull request branch.
3. Create a pull request to merge the new branch into the currently active branch executing the workflow.

## Usage

Linux
```yml
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v1.5.1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Multi platform - Linux, MacOS, Windows (beta)
```yml
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v1.5.1-multi
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

**Note**: If you want pull requests created by this action to trigger an `on: pull_request` workflow then you must use a Personal Access Token instead of the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
See [this issue](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/issues/48) for further details.

### Environment variables

These variables are *all optional*. If not set, sensible default values will be used.

| Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `COMMIT_MESSAGE` | The message to use when committing changes. | `Auto-committed changes by create-pull-request action` |
| `COMMIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` | The email address of the commit author. | For `push` events, the HEAD commit author. Otherwise, <GITHUB_ACTOR>@users.noreply.github.com, where `GITHUB_ACTOR` is the GitHub user that initiated the event. |
| `COMMIT_AUTHOR_NAME` | The name of the commit author. | For `push` events, the HEAD commit author. Otherwise, <GITHUB_ACTOR>, the GitHub user that initiated the event. |
| `PULL_REQUEST_TITLE` | The title of the pull request. | `Auto-generated by create-pull-request action` |
| `PULL_REQUEST_BODY` | The body of the pull request. | `Auto-generated pull request by [create-pull-request](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request) GitHub Action` |
| `PULL_REQUEST_LABELS` | A comma separated list of labels. | `none` |
| `PULL_REQUEST_ASSIGNEES` | A comma separated list of assignees (GitHub usernames). | `none` |
| `PULL_REQUEST_REVIEWERS` | A comma separated list of reviewers (GitHub usernames) to request a review from. | `none` |
| `PULL_REQUEST_TEAM_REVIEWERS` | A comma separated list of GitHub teams to request a review from. | `none` |
| `PULL_REQUEST_MILESTONE` | The number of the milestone to associate this pull request with. | `none` |
| `PULL_REQUEST_BRANCH` | The branch name. See **Branch naming** below for details. | `create-pull-request/patch` |
| `BRANCH_SUFFIX` | The branch suffix type. Valid values are `short-commit-hash`, `timestamp`, `random` and `none`. See **Branch naming** below for details. | `short-commit-hash` |

**Output environment variables**

- `PULL_REQUEST_NUMBER` - The number of the pull request created.

**Debug environment variables**

The following parameters are available for debugging and troubleshooting.

- `DEBUG_EVENT` - If present, outputs the event data that triggered the workflow.
- `SKIP_IGNORE` - If present, the `ignore_event` function will be skipped.

### Branch naming

For branch naming there are two strategies. Always create a new branch each time there are changes to be committed, OR, create a fixed-name pull request branch that will be updated with any new commits until it is merged or closed.

#### Strategy A - Always create a new pull request branch (default)

For this strategy there are three options to suffix the branch name.
The branch name is defined by the variable `PULL_REQUEST_BRANCH` and defaults to `create-pull-request/patch`. The following options are values for `BRANCH_SUFFIX`.

- `short-commit-hash` (default) - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with the short SHA1 commit hash. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-fcdfb59`, `create-pull-request/patch-394710b`

- `timestamp` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed by a timestamp. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-1569322532`, `create-pull-request/patch-1569322552`

- `random` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with a random alpha-numeric string. This option should be used if multiple pull requests will be created during the execution of a workflow. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-6qj97jr`, `create-pull-request/patch-5jrjhvd`

#### Strategy B - Create and update a pull request branch

To use this strategy, set `BRANCH_SUFFIX` to the value `none`. The variable `PULL_REQUEST_BRANCH` defaults to `create-pull-request/patch`. Commits will be made to this branch and a pull request created. Any subsequent changes will be committed to the *same* branch and reflected in the existing pull request.

### Ignoring files

If there are files or directories you want to ignore you can simply add them to a `.gitignore` file at the root of your repository. The action will respect this file.

## Examples

Here is an example that sets all the main environment variables.

```yml
on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [create-pull-request]
name: create-pull-request workflow
jobs:
  createPullRequest:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Create report file
        run: date +%s > report.txt
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v1.5.1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          COMMIT_MESSAGE: Add report file
          COMMIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL: peter-evans@users.noreply.github.com
          COMMIT_AUTHOR_NAME: Peter Evans
          PULL_REQUEST_TITLE: '[Example] Add report file'
          PULL_REQUEST_BODY: >
            This PR is auto-generated by 
            [create-pull-request](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request).
          PULL_REQUEST_LABELS: report, automated pr
          PULL_REQUEST_ASSIGNEES: peter-evans
          PULL_REQUEST_REVIEWERS: peter-evans
          PULL_REQUEST_MILESTONE: 1
          PULL_REQUEST_BRANCH: example-patches
          BRANCH_SUFFIX: short-commit-hash
      - name: Check output environment variable
        run: echo "Pull Request Number - $PULL_REQUEST_NUMBER"
```

This configuration will create pull requests that look like this:

### Dynamic configuration using variables

The following examples show how configuration for the action can be dynamically defined in a previous workflow step.

The recommended method is to use `set-output`. Note that the step where output variables are defined must have an id.

```yml
      - name: Set output variables
        id: vars
        run: |
          echo ::set-output name=pr_title::"[Test] Add report file $(date +%d-%m-%Y)"
          echo ::set-output name=pr_body::"This PR was auto-generated on $(date +%d-%m-%Y) \
            by [create-pull-request](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request)."
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v1.5.1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          PULL_REQUEST_TITLE: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.pr_title }}
          PULL_REQUEST_BODY: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.pr_body }}
```

Since the action reads environment variables from the system, it's technically not necessary to explicitly pass them as long as they exist in the environment. So the following method using `set-env` *also* works, but explicitly passing the configuration parameters using the previous method is perferred for its clarity.

```yml
      - name: Set environment variables
        run: |
          echo ::set-env name=PULL_REQUEST_TITLE::"[Test] Add report file $(date +%d-%m-%Y)"
          echo ::set-env name=PULL_REQUEST_BODY::"This PR was auto-generated on $(date +%d-%m-%Y) \
            by [create-pull-request](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request)."
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v1.5.1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
