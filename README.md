A GitHub action to create a pull request for changes to your repository in the actions workspace.

Changes to a repository in the Actions workspace persist between steps in a workflow.
This action is designed to be used in conjunction with other steps that modify or add files to your repository.
The changes will be automatically committed to a new branch and a pull request created.

Create Pull Request action will:

1. Check for repository changes in the Actions workspace. This includes untracked (new) files as well as modified files.
2. Commit all changes to a new branch. The commit will be made using the name and email of the `HEAD` commit author.
3. Create a pull request to merge the new branch into the currently active branch executing the workflow.

Note: Modifying a repository during workflows is not good practice in general.
However, this action opens up some interesting possibilities when used carefully.
This action is experimental and may not work well for some use cases.

## Usage

Linux
```yml
    - name: Create Pull Request
      uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v1.3.1
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Multi platform - Linux, MacOS, Windows (beta)
```yml
    - name: Create Pull Request
      uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v1.2.1-multi
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

#### Environment variables

These variables are all optional. If not set, a default value will be used.

- `COMMIT_MESSAGE` - The message to use when committing changes.
- `PULL_REQUEST_TITLE` - The title of the pull request.
- `PULL_REQUEST_BODY` - The body of the pull request.
- `PULL_REQUEST_LABELS` - A comma separated list of labels.
- `PULL_REQUEST_ASSIGNEES` - A comma separated list of assignees (GitHub usernames).
- `PULL_REQUEST_REVIEWERS` - A comma separated list of reviewers (GitHub usernames) to request a review from.
- `PULL_REQUEST_TEAM_REVIEWERS` - A comma separated list of GitHub teams to request a review from.
- `PULL_REQUEST_MILESTONE` - The number of the milestone to associate this pull request with.
- `PULL_REQUEST_BRANCH` - The branch name. See **Branch naming** below for details.
- `BRANCH_SUFFIX` - The branch suffix type. Valid values are `short-commit-hash` (default) and `timestamp`. See **Branch naming** below for details.

The following parameters are available for debugging and troubleshooting.

- `DEBUG_EVENT` - If present, outputs the event data that triggered the workflow.
- `SKIP_IGNORE` - If present, the `ignore_event` function will be skipped.

#### Branch naming

The variable `PULL_REQUEST_BRANCH` defaults to `create-pull-request/patch`.
Commits will be made to a branch with this name and suffixed with the short SHA1 commit hash.

e.g.
```
create-pull-request/patch-fcdfb59
create-pull-request/patch-394710b
```

Alternatively, branches can be suffixed with a timestamp by setting the environment variable `BRANCH_SUFFIX` to the value `timestamp`. This option must be used if multiple pull requests will be created during the execution of a workflow.

e.g.
```
create-pull-request/patch-1569322532
create-pull-request/patch-1569322552
```

#### Ignoring files

If there are files or directories you want to ignore you can simply add them to a `.gitignore` file at the root of your repository. The action will respect this file.

## Example

Here is an example that sets all the main environment variables.

```yml
on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [create-pull-request]
name: create-pull-request workflow
jobs:
  createPullRequest:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Create report file
      run: touch report.txt
    - name: Create Pull Request
      uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v1.3.1
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        COMMIT_MESSAGE: Add report file
        PULL_REQUEST_BODY: This PR is auto-generated by [create-pull-request](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request).
        PULL_REQUEST_TITLE: '[Example] New report'
        PULL_REQUEST_LABELS: report, automated pr
        PULL_REQUEST_ASSIGNEES: peter-evans
        PULL_REQUEST_REVIEWERS: peter-evans
        PULL_REQUEST_MILESTONE: 1
        PULL_REQUEST_BRANCH: example-patches
        BRANCH_SUFFIX: short-commit-hash
```

This configuration will create pull requests that look like this:
